2 things programmer needs to:
 1. create custom vertex and fragment shader and write code to pass them into program
 2. create buffer containing verticies data and a way to interpret them

3 steps to create shader
 1. Create shader
 2. Attach it to it's source code
 3. Compile it
GLuint vertexShader - shader reference
glCreateShader(TYPE) - creates shader 
glShaderSource(SHADER, HowMuchString, SHADER_ADDRESS, NULL) - attaches shader to it's source code
glCompileShader(SHADER) - compiles attached shader source code

glBufferData(TYPE, SIZEOF, VERTICIES, STATIC/DYNAMIC_DRAW/READ/COPY)
